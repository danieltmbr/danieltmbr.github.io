I always think of the summer as an opportunity for a fresh start. ☀️ Days seem longer and I feel more energetic like I can do anything within a minute. Even if I'm postponing, I still feel like I have a whole bunch of days remaining. 🏖

![Meme: It's a trap!][itsatrap]

The length of the days are the same and I'm not able to work 4 time faster. No, not even 2 times. Days are counting and summer comes to its end real quick. ⏳ 
The best way not to waste my 'creative summer break' is creating a detailed plan 📝. Firstly, I created a 'backlog' (To-Do list) of 'tasks' (topics) with estimated time consumption - or how much time I tend to deal with a topic. Then, instead of real sprints, I established deadlines which help me notice if I'm on schedule or not. 

![Meme: We'll ask for estimates ... and then treat them as deadlines][agiledeadline]

I don't believe in just walking through tutorials. It's better to use the new techniques in real projects, but at work you don't always have a chance for doing that. 😫 So I picked some passion projects on which I can practice newly acquired knowledge. Primiarily, I'll deal with iOS projects 📱, but to widen my aspects I'm going to learn server side, web frontend and desktop technologies and programming languages as well. 🖥

So this blog is dedicated to my thoughts 💭 of the technologies I'll try during the summer. You can find my scheduled To-Do list below.👇 
I'll keep this post updated with the following progress notations:
* [ &nbsp;] - Not started yet
* [⇢] - In progress 
* [✓] - Done 
* [𐄂] - Not on the list anymore

Have fun. 🎉
